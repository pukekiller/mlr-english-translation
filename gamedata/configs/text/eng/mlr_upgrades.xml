	</string>
	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_RPM_2_descr">
		<text>This alloy made of the artifacts Jellyfish and Slug was not chosen by chance. Should increase the fire rate using the gravity of artifacts and not to overdo it with the emitted field. Through trial and error by stalkers, this recipe of influence on the firing mechanism was built, which only slightly increases its wear.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_RPM_3_descr">
		<text>Elements of the Medusa artifact allow to slightly increase the speed of the mobile mechanism, and a Fireball, more precisely its core - reduce the associated overheating.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_RPM_4_descr">
		<text>Elements of the Night Star artifact allow to slightly increase the speed of the mobile mechanism, and a Flame, more precisely its core - reduce the associated overheating.</text>
	</string>


	<!-- Recoil -->

	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_RECOIL_name">
		<text>Recoil reduction</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_RECOIL_descr">
		<text>A Wrenched together with a Jellyfish emit a weak gravitational field, which allows, when properly applied, to stabilize the recoil of the weapon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_RECOIL_2_descr">
		<text>Due to its gravitational nature and properties, the Jellyfish artifact is used to stabilize the weapon and reduce its recoil.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_RECOIL_3_descr">
		<text>It is difficult to stabilize and reduce the kickback of a shotgun, so local craftsmen came up with the idea of using small pieces of the Night Star artifact to solve this problem.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_RECOIL_4_descr">
		<text>To stabilize the machine guns, stalkers usually use the properties of the artifacts Night Star together with a Gravi.</text>
	</string>


	<!-- Reliability -->

	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_RELIABILITY_name">
		<text>Reliability increase</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_RELIABILITY_descr">
		<text>As it turned out, the gaseous substances released by artifacts positively affect the characteristics of the metal, increasing its strength.</text>

	<!-- Weight -->

	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_WEIGHT_name">
		<text>Weight reduction</text>

		<text>Installation of the artifact particle of a Stone Blood</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_a2_descr">
		<text>Few people know, but the dry mass allocated by an artifact which absorbs temporary chemical effects has the property of corroding any dirt that somehow finds itself in the receiver, which relieves the wearer of exhausting procedures for cleaning weapons, needing instead only to shake it out sometimes.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_a5_name">
		<text>Coating of the recoil mechanism</text>
	</string>

		<text>Alloy with artifacts Jellyfish and Battery</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_a6_descr">
		<text>Stalkers realized that when the Jellyfish and Battery artifacts come in contact, the latter changes the properties of the gravitational field of the first. Thus, installing particles of these artifacts close to each other makes it possible to stabilize the weapon during fire.</text>

	<string id="st_up_assault_rifle_mlr_a7_descr">
		<text>As in the case of the Battery, stalkers noticed the influence of the Flash artifact on the Night Star, by "spurring" its properties with small discharges. Correct placement of such fragments allows to significantly stabilize the weapon, making it more convenient to operate.</text>
